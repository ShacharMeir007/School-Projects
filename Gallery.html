    <p id="par">Devices may be hosts (
        DFP: Downstream-facing port) or peripherals
        (UFP: Upstream-facing port). Some, such as mobile phones, can take
        either role depending on what kind is detected on the other end.
        These types of ports are called Dual-Role-Data (DRD) ports, which was known as USB On-The-Go in previous specification.[12] When two such devices are connected, the roles are randomly assigned but a swap can be commanded from either end, although there are optional path and role detection methods that would allow devices to select a preference for a specific role.
        Furthermore, dual-role devices that implement USB Power Delivery may independently and dynamically swap data and power roles using the Data Role Swap or Power Role Swap processes. This allows for charge-through hub or docking station applications where
        the USB-C device acts as a USB data host while acting as a power consumer rather than a source.[5]

        USB-C devices may optionally provide or consume bus power currents of 1.5 A and 3.0 A (at 5 V) in addition to baseline bus power provision; power sources can either advertise increased USB current through the configuration channel, or they can implement the full USB Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded V
